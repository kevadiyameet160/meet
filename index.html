    <p class="p2"><span class="s1">Thank you for using the Dictionary App ("App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your personal information when you use our App, as well as the choices you have regarding your information.

        Information We Collect
        1.1 Personal Information:
        We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) about you unless you voluntarily provide it to us. However, certain non-personally identifiable information may be collected automatically, as described below.
        
        1.2 Non-Personal Information:
        When you use the App, we may collect non-personal information, such as your device's operating system version, unique device identifiers, IP address, usage statistics, and other technical data. This information is collected to improve the functionality and performance of the App and to provide a better user experience.
        
        Use of Information
        2.1 Personal Information:
        We do not collect any personal information through the App. Any personal information voluntarily provided by you through support inquiries or feedback may be used solely for the purpose of addressing your request or inquiry.
        
        2.2 Non-Personal Information:
        The non-personal information collected is used for analytical purposes, such as monitoring app usage patterns, improving the App's features and performance, and providing personalized content. This information may also be used for troubleshooting, debugging, and maintaining the App's overall security.
        
        Third-Party Services
        We may use third-party services, such as analytics providers and advertising networks, to assist us in providing and improving the App. These third-party services may collect and process non-personal information about your device and App usage. Please note that these third-party services have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them.
        
        Data Retention
        We retain non-personal information collected through the App for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. We do not retain any personal information through the App.
        
        Security
        We take reasonable measures to protect the information collected through the App from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, please note that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee absolute security.
        
        Children's Privacy
        The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us, and we will delete such information from our systems.
        
        Changes to this Privacy Policy
        We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time. When we make changes, we will revise the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. Your continued use of the App after any such changes indicates your acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy for the latest information on our privacy practices.
